		// chance to overflow the element numeric data type, is given by

		//        Size in bits = 1 + lg(Factor size) + lg((BASE-1)^2)
		//
		// and this largest element occurs when multiplying all nines by all nines, i.e. a number
		// of the form (BASE^N - 1) with itself, where N is the factor size.
		//
		// What we want is the largest factor size, which is:
		//
		//        Factor size = 2^(Size in bits - 1 - lg((BASE-1)^2)).
		//
		// For example, with a bit size of 53 bits (i.e. an IEEE 754 double), and BASE of 10000,
		// we have a max size of a bit more than 9M elements, or 36M decimal digits. For a BASE of
		// 456976 (26^4), i.e. macro-base 26 with 4 base-26 digits per Digit, we have a max size of
		// 43,132 or 172,530 base-26 digits. If we want to go larger than these, we must use smaller
		// bases.

		// This actually underestimates a bit, which hopefully should compensate for other errors.
